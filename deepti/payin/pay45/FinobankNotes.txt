process of finobank integration

 For encryption and decryption logic file name is finobank.php
 encryption and decryption method will be same for all api
just need to change request and url

1.create vpa
(open the file FinobankQrRequest.php and there is request for create vpa)
when we will hit this api will get vpa in response
for example sky.shivam@fin

2.Qr generate for this we will check the hard code in finobankQrRequest.php file
we will get the responsedata field in response
in this field we will get decrypted string 
we will decrypt the response data field value with decryption method 
now we will get base64 encode string for qr 
now we will generate qr from this
  
 3.initiate collect isi ke ander hai, FinobankQrRequest.php
  "payeraddr": "pravin99@fin",by using this address
  we will use our upi address in this
  
  4.status Api for this Api we will use clienttxnId mobilenumber,refferencenumber,serviceid
  there is a important note we are using diffrent serviceid for every Api
  Like qr 9072 please follow the hard code
  we need to configure webhook in their system 
  need to change parameter for sending return response according to their requirements
  
  there was some problem in acquirer-45 when i was working on this
  I saved vlaue in data base from the response or request 
  value was not saving in the database
  
  I made function file seperately function_45.do to call in acquirer-45.do
  but i include this file function was not calling please check this
